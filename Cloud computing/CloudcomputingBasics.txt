DAY1:

Types of cloud computing
1. IAAS :infrastructure as a service
2. PAAS:platform as a service
3. SAAS:software as a service

1. IAAS:Gives full control over infra resources such as virtual machines/storage ,you must take care of all admin task such as patching upgrading backups also,it is pay per use like EC2,VM,GCE. ideal choice for life ans shift migration and legacy application
2. PAAS:give run time environment/platform to deploy application and development tools,azure take care of all the admin task including automated backups,pay per service model,azure web app,ideal choice where customer doesnt want to handle admin part .
3. SAAS:give application access to the end userr,azure take care of all the admin tasks,pay per subscribtion model,dropbox,gmail etc,ideal choice where customer can use the standard version of a cloud application


DAY2:
Difference between public cloud private cloud and hybrid cloud:
1.public cloud:resources are shared among multiple users and customer only pay for the resources they use,hosted and operated by third party such as aws,azure,gcp
2.private cloud:resources are not share with other organizations providing greater control and security,operated and maintained by a single organization,it may be hosted on premises or in a data center
3.hybrid cloud:uses both public and private cloud in an interconnected environment,provide extra layer of security ,user can choose which resource to keep in private and which resource to deploy in public 


Benefits of cloud computing:
#High availability and fault tolerance
#scalability

horizontal vs vertical scale:vertical scaling refers to like for eg there is one vm1 and you will replace all the data to vm2 which is bigger size of vm1 and you completly close the vm1,now horizontal scaling means you will add more vm2 vm3 in vm1(in most of the cases it is prefer)

#elasticity:similar to scalability ,it automatically escale the cloud whenever there is load on the system and heavy traffic
#cost effecitveness:1.pricing calculator:estimate price of using azure services,2.TCO(Total cost of ownership): it estimate total saving when migrating to own primeses to cloud


DAY3:
Azure resource hierachy:
                          Azure account
                               |
                            subscriptions(sales dept,IT dept)
                               |
                            Resource groups(dev,product)
                               |
                            Resources(SQl,Azure)
It follows top down approach.

Azure Management groups:
                         Root Management group
            --------------------------------------------------------------------
                |              |        |           |               |
            Human resources    IT     Marketing   EA subscriptions  EA subscriptions
      -------------             |
       |                    Production
      Dev/test subscriptions                ------------------
                          |            |
                         Geo region1  Geo region2



DAY4:
Learn about basic azure console and create free trail account

DAY5:
availability zones:many azure zones  provide availability zones ,which are separated groups of datacenters within a region .each has independent power,cooling ,networking infrastructure so that if one zone experiences an outage then regional service,capacity and high availability are supported by the remaining zones
they are usually within 100km

DAY6:
virtual machines:a computer sitting on the cloud that you are renting for your specific uses 

DAY7:
virtual machine scale sets:it allows automatic scalling of multiple virtual machine based on demand 

DAY8:
Azure virtual desktop:type of managed virtual machine that enables multiple users to access virtual desktops and applications from anywhere using any device.it is a desktop and application virtualization service that run on the cloud ,it provides a scalable and secure solution for remote work and desktop virtualization,secure access through MFA and RBACs

Difference between azure virtual desktop(avd)and azure virtual machines(VMs):
Azure virtual desktop:uses desktop operating systems like window 10 or 11,designed for many user to access the same desktop, managed by the microsoft take care of maintanenace update,charges per user per month
Azure virtual machines: can use  either desktop or server operating system,typically intended for only one user at one time ,managed by the customer,pay per user model

DAY 9:
Azure container instances:
it is a serverless container solution that lets your docker containers in the cloud without managing virtual machine
it allows you to deploy and run container directly on azure without needing or orchestron platform like kubernet

DAY10:
Azure functions:they are event driven serverless compute functions.
1.event driven:it is executed based on some event,there are different types like http,time based,message from other service
2. serverless:pay only for execution time 
3.compute:it is a compute service that can be used to perform some task

DAY11:
Azure app service:it is a platform as a service,to build and host application in any programming languages:web app using Azure web apps,background jobs using Azure webjobs,mobile backend using Mobile apps ,restful apis using apis app,it also support automatically scalling and high availability.
more feature like support linux and windows 

DAY12:
Azure  networking service:
#azure virtual network:it is cloud based network environment,it allows you to create and managed your own isolated network,these are highly scalable and secure.

DAY13:Azure virtual network peering and virtual private network(VPN):
azure virtual network(VNet):it is a private,isolated network in azure where you can securely connect and manages vms,database,container and services
azure virtual network peering:it is a feature that allows you to connect two or more VNets
azure virtual network(VPN):it is a secure connection between your on premises network and azure virtual network

DAY14:Azure express route and Azure DNS:
Azure express route:it is a dedicated,private connection between on premises data center and azure cloud services bypassing the public internet 
Benefits of using express route is it doesnt go over public internet
Azure Domain Name service(DNS):it is a high perfomance scalable and secure domain name system service hosted in azure.

DAY 15:Azure storage accounts ,storage types and storage tiers:
#Blob storage:used to serving images or document directly to a browser(static website hosting),storing file for distrubuted access,streaming video and audio,also use for storing data for backup and restore disaster recovery and archiving 
#azure file storage:it enables you to create files shares in the cloud and access these files shares from anywhere with an internect connection,it exposes file share using the server msg block 3.0(SMB)protocol
once you have created a storage account,you can upload files to azure file storage using the azure portals or tools such as AzCopy utillity 
attaching a network drive to multiple computers,it has two perfomance tiers .:
1.The standard tier uses hard disk based hardware in a datacenter
2. premium tier uses solid state disks.the premium tier offers greater throughout but it is charged at higher rate .

#Azure Queue Storage:it is a cloud-based message queuing service that enables you to send and you can store a massive sem structure data means no SQL data that doesnt  requirre fix schema such as JSON file   

#storage accounts:it is used to store messages,file ,unstructured data,semi structured data.it is highly scalable ,storage account name would be unique within azure 
#storage  access tiers:
1. Hot tiers:it is the default tier ,used to access frequetly access data ,provide highest performance but it is costliest,and colliest among there  
2. cool tier :used for infrequent data access to storage for at least 30 days,cheaper then hot tier,lower perfomance then hot tier,you can migrate your storage from hot tier to coll tier to save storage cost.
3. Archieve tier:it cannot be set at the account level,used for archievel storage at least 180days,highest latency,take hours for data retrieval,to retrieve a blob from the archieve tier you must change the access tier to hot or cool.the blob will then be rehydrated.you can read the blob only when the rehydration process is complete.cheapest among all

#azure storage redundancy:it ensure data remains available and protested against hardware failure natural disaster and data corruption.
types of storage redundancy:
1.Locally rendundant storage:3 copies with single datacenter
2.zone rendundant storage:3 copies across 3 availability zones in the same region
3.geo rendundant storage:6 copies(3 local copies+3 in a secondary region)
4.read-access geo rendundant storage:6 copies(grs)+read access to secondary regions
5.geo zone rendundant storage:6 copies(3 zone rendundant+3 in secondary region)
