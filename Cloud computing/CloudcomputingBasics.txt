DAY1:

Types of cloud computing
1. IAAS :infrastructure as a service
2. PAAS:platform as a service
3. SAAS:software as a service

1. IAAS:Gives full control over infra resources such as virtual machines/storage ,you must take care of all admin task such as patching upgrading backups also,it is pay per use like EC2,VM,GCE. ideal choice for life ans shift migration and legacy application
2. PAAS:give run time environment/platform to deploy application and development tools,azure take care of all the admin task including automated backups,pay per service model,azure web app,ideal choice where customer doesnt want to handle admin part .
3. SAAS:give application access to the end userr,azure take care of all the admin tasks,pay per subscribtion model,dropbox,gmail etc,ideal choice where customer can use the standard version of a cloud application


DAY2:
Difference between public cloud private cloud and hybrid cloud:
1.public cloud:resources are shared among multiple users and customer only pay for the resources they use,hosted and operated by third party such as aws,azure,gcp
2.private cloud:resources are not share with other organizations providing greater control and security,operated and maintained by a single organization,it may be hosted on premises or in a data center
3.hybrid cloud:uses both public and private cloud in an interconnected environment,provide extra layer of security ,user can choose which resource to keep in private and which resource to deploy in public 


Benefits of cloud computing:
#High availability and fault tolerance
#scalability

horizontal vs vertical scale:vertical scaling refers to like for eg there is one vm1 and you will replace all the data to vm2 which is bigger size of vm1 and you completly close the vm1,now horizontal scaling means you will add more vm2 vm3 in vm1(in most of the cases it is prefer)

#elasticity:similar to scalability ,it automatically escale the cloud whenever there is load on the system and heavy traffic
#cost effecitveness:1.pricing calculator:estimate price of using azure services,2.TCO(Total cost of ownership): it estimate total saving when migrating to own primeses to cloud


DAY3:
Azure resource hierachy:
                          Azure account
                               |
                            subscriptions(sales dept,IT dept)
                               |
                            Resource groups(dev,product)
                               |
                            Resources(SQl,Azure)
It follows top down approach.

Azure Management groups:
                         Root Management group
            --------------------------------------------------------------------
                |              |        |           |               |
            Human resources    IT     Marketing   EA subscriptions  EA subscriptions
      -------------             |
       |                    Production
      Dev/test subscriptions                ------------------
                          |            |
                         Geo region1  Geo region2



DAY4:
Learn about basic azure console and create free trail account

DAY5:
availability zones:many azure zones  provide availability zones ,which are separated groups of datacenters within a region .each has independent power,cooling ,networking infrastructure so that if one zone experiences an outage then regional service,capacity and high availability are supported by the remaining zones
they are usually within 100km

DAY6:
virtual machines:a computer sitting on the cloud that you are renting for your specific uses 

DAY7:
virtual machine scale sets:it allows automatic scalling of multiple virtual machine based on demand 

DAY8:
Azure virtual desktop:type of managed virtual machine that enables multiple users to access virtual desktops and applications from anywhere using any device.it is a desktop and application virtualization service that run on the cloud ,it provides a scalable and secure solution for remote work and desktop virtualization,secure access through MFA and RBACs

Difference between azure virtual desktop(avd)and azure virtual machines(VMs):
Azure virtual desktop:uses desktop operating systems like window 10 or 11,designed for many user to access the same desktop, managed by the microsoft take care of maintanenace update,charges per user per month
Azure virtual machines: can use  either desktop or server operating system,typically intended for only one user at one time ,managed by the customer,pay per user model

DAY 9:
Azure container instances:
it is a serverless container solution that lets your docker containers in the cloud without managing virtual machine
it allows you to deploy and run container directly on azure without needing or orchestron platform like kubernet
