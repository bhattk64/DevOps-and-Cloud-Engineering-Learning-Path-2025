DNS-Domain name system is a protocol that translates human readable domain names(eg:google.com)int IP address(142.245.132.87).It acts like phonebook of the internet alllowin user to access website using domain name instead of numerical IP address.
DNS working architecture:
1.user request:you type google.com in browser.
2.dns resolver:request goes to dns solver
3.root dns server:resolver asks the root dns server where .com domains are located.
4.tld server:resolver than queries the top level domain server.
5.authorative dns server:tld directs the resolver to the authorative dns server for google.com
6.response:the dns server return the ip address to the browser.
7.website loads:browser connects to the ip and loads the website

Types of DNS records:
1.A:maps hostnames to IP addresses
2.NS:maps domain names to name servers
3.CNAME:maps domain names to canonical names
4.AAAA:maps a domain to an IPv6 address

DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):It is responsible for automatically assigning IP addresses to devices in a network. Without DHCP, you’d need to manually configure IP addresses for each device.

DHCP working flow:
1. Discovery: A device (client) connects to a network and broadcasts a DHCP request (DHCPDISCOVER).
2️. Offer: The DHCP server responds with an available IP address lease (DHCPOFFER).
3️. Request: The client accepts the offered IP by sending a DHCPREQUEST message.
4️. Acknowledgment: The DHCP server assigns the IP and confirms (DHCPACK).
