1. Database sharding:sharding is the process of splitting a large database into smaller independent databases to distribute the load.(Each shard handles a subset of the data,increase a scalability by distributing queries across multiple machines,reduce single point of failures)
Working of sharding:data is partitioned horizontally across multiple services,each shard has a portion of the dataset,A shard key determines which shard hold the data.
best use case:large scale application(eg:facebook)

2. Database caching:caching storage frequently accessed data in a fast ,in memory system to improve perfomance and reduce database load

Types of caching:
#application level caching:eg:storing result in memory variables.
#database query caching:eg:mysql query cache.
#distributed caching:eg:redis

best use cases:apis that fetchh same data repeatedily
