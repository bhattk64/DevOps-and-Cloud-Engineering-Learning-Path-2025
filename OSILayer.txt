OSI MODEL:The open system interconnection model is a conceptual frmework that standarize network communication accross different systems .
It is consist of 7 layers

Overview of OSI MODEL:

7. Application=provide network services to application(eg:http)
6. Presentation=Data encryption,compression
5. Session=Manages session and connection between application 
4. Transport=Ensure reliable or fast delivery of Data
3. Network=Determines IP addressing ,routing and packet forwarding
2. Data Link=Manages MAC addressing and switches (WIFI,ethernet)
1. Physical=Deal with hardware ,cables signals 

OSI layers in Detail:
1. Physical Layer:Responsible for transmissing raw binary data(0s and 1s)over a medium
Include hardware like cables,fiber optics
No data interpretation,only singnal transmission(wifi,bluetooth)

2. Data Link Layer:Handles MAC(media access control)addressing
ensure error detection using CRC(cycle redundancy check)
Divided into two sublayers(MAC sublayer-control how devices access media,LLC(logical link control)-provides error checking)

3. Network Layer:Responsible for routing packets between network using IP addressing
uses logical addressing(IPv4/IPv6) to identify devices

4. Transport Layer:Ensures reliable or fast delivery of data
uses segmentation,flow control and error handling
TCP(transmission control protocol)-reliable connection,no error checking

5. Session Layer:Manages session establishment maintenance,and termination
keep track of multiple communication session between system

6. Presentation Layer:convert data into readable format for application
encoding and decoding of data 

7. Application Layer:provides user interaction with the network 
Handle network services like HTTP,SMTP
