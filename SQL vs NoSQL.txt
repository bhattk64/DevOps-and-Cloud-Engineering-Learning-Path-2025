structured query language(SQL):these are relational databases(RDBMS)that stored data in structured tables and rows and columns.They use query for querying and enforcing strict schema constraints.eg(mysql,oracle,postgresql)

key features of SQL databases:
1. structured schema:data must follow predefined schema.
2. ACID compilance:ensure data consistency and reliablity.
3. Relational model:Table are linked with foreign keys
4. Scalability:Vertical scaling(adding more power to single server)
best usecases:Banking  and finance,ecommerce.

Not only SQL(NoSQL):they are non relational and store data in flexible ,unstructured or semi structured formats like key value document coloumn or graph based storage.eg:mongodb.
best for scalable,flexible and high speed application

ðŸ“Œ When to Choose SQL vs NoSQL?

âœ… Use SQL if:

You need strong data integrity & consistency (e.g., banking, finance)
Your data is highly structured and requires complex queries (JOINs, transactions)
Youâ€™re building an enterprise system (CRM, ERP, HRMS)


âœ… Use NoSQL if:

You need scalability (handling large amounts of unstructured data)
Your application has real-time processing needs (social media, analytics)
You want flexibility in schema (rapid development, dynamic data models)
