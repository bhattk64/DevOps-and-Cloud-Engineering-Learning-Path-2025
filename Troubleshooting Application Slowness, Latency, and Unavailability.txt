step1:Identify the scope of the problem
#Is the issue affecting all users or only some?(Global vs Regional vs user specific)
#Is the entire application slow or just specific features.
#Is it happening at specific time of day(peak traffic hours?)
#Has anything changed recently?(Deployment,updates)

step2:check application logs and errors 
Tools:
#Application logs :tail -f /var/log/app.log
#Web server logs: tail -f/var/log/ngnix/access.log
#Database logs: journalctl -u mysql
#System logs: dmesg|tail
#Error tracking tools:Datadog,new relic

Common errors:
#500 Internal server error-application crash or misconfiguration
#502 bad gateway -reverse proxy or backend service issue.
#503 service unavailable -overloaded server
#database connection failures:too many connection or downed DB

step3:check server and infrastructure health
